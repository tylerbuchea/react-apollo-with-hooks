# React Apollo vs React Apollo Hooks

[Check out the blog post for more info](https://blog.tylerbuchea.com/use-react-apollo-with-hooks/)

This repo shows two components being used side-by-side in `./src/index.js`.

One of the components `NewWay` uses React hooks and Suspense to retrieve data from a GraphQL API.

The other component `OldWay` uses render props to accomplish the same task.

The goal of this repo is to be a simple side-by-side comparison of the two approaches.
